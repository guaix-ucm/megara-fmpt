# Pair (PP, DP) outputs generated from FMOSA megara-cb0.txt
# Generated with FMPT version 4.8.0 and FMM Instance version 1
# Date of generation: 2017-08-23T21:00:04Z
# This pair (PP, DP) has been generated without enabled-not-operative RPs.
# The pair (PP, DP) has been generated without neither collided nor obstructed RPs.
# A pair (PP, DP) is suitable to be executed when it is valid (avoid collisions) and there aren't
# dangerous RPs in the Fiber MOS (enabled-not-operative RPs with fault type dynamic or unknowledge),
# and there aren't neither collided nor obstructed RPs.
# According the actual status of the FMPT, this pair (PP, DP) is suitable to be executed.

# Positioning program
# This PP avoids collisions when it is executed starting from the initial positions.
# All radial movements of this PP keep a security distance upper or equal to 1 mm.

# Depositioning program
# This DP avoids collisions when it is executed starting from the observing positions.
# All radial movements of this DP keep a security distance upper or equal to 1 mm.
