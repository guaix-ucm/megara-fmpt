# This parking program has been generated without enabled-not-operative RPs.
# The parking program has been generated without neither collided nor obstructed RPs.
# A parking program is suitable to be executed when it is valid (avoid collisions) and there aren't
# dangerous RPs in the Fiber MOS (enabled-not-operative RPs with fault type dynamic or unknowledge).
# According the actual status of the FMPT, this parking program is suitable to be executed.

# Parking program
# This parking program avoids collisions when it is executed starting from the starting positions.
# All radial movements of this parking program keep a security distance upper or equal to 1 mm.
