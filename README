Known issues
============
The package fails to compile with clang, the default compiler in Mac OSX 10.9
and upper. To compile in these versions, the GNU C++ compiler is required.
To override the default compiler use the following sintax:

$ ./configure CXX=/path/to/gnu-g++/binary

and then 'make', 'make install' as usual
