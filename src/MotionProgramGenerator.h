//will avoid dynamic collisions. For accomplish of this purpose the MPG
//will make use of the validator function, to assure that the generation
//process is valid. Each MP shall go with an IPL (Initial Position List)
//of type TPairsPositionAngleList.

    //shall be upper zero
    //default value: -M_PI/36 rad

    //It is desirable that the jump is expressed in radians and not in steps,
    //for several reasons:
    // - If the number of steps change, the jump not should vary.
    // - The rotor position and their domain limits, are stored in radians
    //   so that the checking belonging to domain, could introduce numerical
    //   errors.

    //Note that when the jump correspond to a integer number of steps, when
    //quantification is enabled, the rotors do not change their positions.
